## What's next for us?

We aim to develop a deliverable product over the upcoming weeks, incorporating features such as geocoding, departure and arrival algorithms, transfer and route information, along with routing algorithms tailored for bicycles, pedestrians, and wheelchair users. Additionally, we plan to launch a mobile application utilizing Flutter.
